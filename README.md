# Potential-well
Given any Potential function(Potential Well) varying over distance, Its wave function and descrete energy eigenstates can be determined by using Shooting and Matching method over one-dimensional time-independent Schrodinger's wave equation for energy eigenstates. This repository contains codes for the same. It considers extensively the special cases:
1. Infinite potential well (Particle in a box)
2. Finite potential well
3. Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
