# Potential-well
Given any Potential function(Potential Well) varying over distance, Its wave function and descrete energy eigenstates can be determined by using Shooting and Matching method over one-dimensional time-independent Schrodinger's wave equation for energy eigenstates. 

It considers extensively the special cases:
Infinite potential well (Particle in a box)
Finite potential well
Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
